        <h3>Agri-Energy Connect Platform</h3>
        <p>
            The Agri-Energy Connect Platform is designed to bridge the gap between agricultural producers and the renewable energy sector.
            Our mission is to facilitate sustainable practices by connecting farmers with energy companies interested in biofuel production,
            biomass energy, and other eco-friendly initiatives.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">What We Do</h4>
        <p>
            Our platform provides a marketplace where farmers can list their agricultural products suitable for energy production,
            such as energy crops, agricultural residues, and organic waste. Energy companies can browse these listings to find
            resources that match their specific needs for sustainable energy production.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Our Vision</h4>
        <p>
            We envision a future where agricultural resources are optimally utilized, reducing waste and contributing to clean energy production.
            By creating this direct connection between farmers and energy companies, we aim to support local economies while promoting
            environmental sustainability.
